bearings :
4 kg : 1st and 2nd work without log... 3rd we have logs (export ROS_MASTER_URI was not done)
8 kg : 1 OK, 2 fails 1st steps (maybe due to ground) and ok, 3rd ok.
14 kg : 1 begins to fails backward and Olivier rescue, then ok
        2 ok,
        3 complete fail (intertrial variability : walking perpendicular to previous ones)
16 kg : not done given from the previous trials

slopes :
npg
1 degree : one bottom to top (forward)
one top to bottom (forward)
2 degreess: bottom to top (forward) -> failure at the beginning (but finished)
1.5 degrees: bottom to top (backward)
1.5 degrees: top to bottom (forward)
2 degrees: bottom to top (backward failure: crack )
2 degrees: top to bottom (forward: ok)
