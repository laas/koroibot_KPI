40 degrees
----------
After 45 degrees we want down to 30 degrees
did a check encoders values, then raised the chamber value up to 40 degrees
CPU temperature was at 60 degrees at start
Did the stairs 15 cm up.
Then stop to do the calibration sensors.
This one failed for the 10 cm degrees.
The internal CPU temperature raised at 68-70 degrees.
We assume that the internal power electronics temperature
raised too much and triggered the internal protection.
