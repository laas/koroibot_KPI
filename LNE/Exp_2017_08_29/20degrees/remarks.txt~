20 degrees:
-----------
CPU raised from 37 degrees to 40-41 degrees. (from 10 to 20)
After the first series of 15 cm up the CPU temperature raised to 43-45 degrees


Stairs 15 cm:
-------------
We had pose calibration problems with the first experiments.
We had to correct the robot at the first trial.
2 experiments (3-4) failed because the robot fall backward


Stairs 10 cm:
-------------
Complete failure the first time.
We had to do a force sensor calibration probably due to temperature difference.
One failure after (but we do not know if it is coming from a shock/disturbance to the robot).
